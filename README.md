# The-EWE-Project
The EWE Project is a collection of free software focused on providing mandatory POSIX core utilities with enhanced portability across almost all platforms including (Windows, Linux and MacOS). All writen in C99

# Building
Run: `make` at the root of the `ewe-headers` directory.
It's gonna create an **ewe** directory in `/usr/include` *(if you dont have one already)* and move the files there **leaving backups**.

> WARNING âš : You can only build for Linux for now.
